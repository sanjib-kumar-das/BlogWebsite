        In this post, let's focus on discovery of pizza. We will learn who
        discovered it, and why you should eat it.
      </p>

      <h3>Who discovered pizza?</h3>

      <p>
        The term pizza was first recorded in the 10th century in a Latin
        manuscript from the Southern Italian town of Gaeta in Lazio, on the
        border with Campania.[4] Modern pizza was invented in Naples, and the
        dish and its variants have since become popular in many countries.[5] It
        has become one of the most popular foods in the world and a common fast
        food item in
        <em>Europe, North America and Australas</em> available at pizzerias
        (restaurants specializing in pizza), restaurants offering Mediterranean
        cuisine, and via pizza delivery.
      </p>

      <p>
        Italy, pizza served in formal settings, such as at a restaurant, is
        presented unsliced, and is eaten with the use of a knife and fork. In
        casual settings, however, it is cut into wedges to be eaten while held
        in the hand.
      </p>

      <p>Pizza is made up of 4 ingredients:-</p>

      <ol>
        <li><p>Pizza Base</p></li>
        <li><p>Toppings</p></li>
        <li><p>Cheese</p></li>
        <li><p>Pizza Sauce</p></li>
      </ol>

      <p>You can learn more at <a href="#">Wikipedia</a></p>

      <h3>How it is made?</h3>

      <p>
        In restaurants, pizza can be baked in an oven with stone bricks above
        the heat source, an electric deck oven, a conveyor belt oven, or, in the
        case of more expensive restaurants, a wood or coal-fired brick oven.

      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>The bottom of the pizza, called the "crust", may vary widely according
          to style</p>
        </li>
        <li>
         <p> Mozzarella is commonly used on pizza, with the highest quality
          mozzarella produced in the surroundings of Naples.
        </li></p>
        <li>
         <p> Other cheeses are also used, particularly Italian cheeses including
          pecorino romano, ricotta, and scamorza.</p>
